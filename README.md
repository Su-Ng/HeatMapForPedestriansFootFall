# HeatMapForPedestriansFootFall
The objective of this depository is to showcase pedestrian footfall. From this video clip, we find out the path that is taken by the pedestrian. This helps the retailer find out where the pedestrian usually walks, to help them make business decisions whether the location is ideal for their shop front, if there are many pedestrians pass through a particular spot.

The brighter the spot, the longer the pedestrians where at a particular spot. It can be observed that at the side of the glass doors, very few pedestrians walk over that area.
